the app has two default security levels the high level and low level

You can add interim  security levels by clicking on the security levels link on the main menu
then new security levels.

Clicking on a level opens a view where you can assign pages to the level by clicking on the "Add page accessible by this security level"

Select the pages u want to add from the dropdown menu to assign pages to a security level

Assign permissions to users by clicking the permissions link then select the appropriate level of permission


Login as the user whose permissions have been added to verify they can assess the links to the newly added pages

e.g "permissions" are high level pages but a default user can assess the pages if for instance the pages "permissions#index" has been added to a new security level "mid" etc
